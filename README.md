# EDA on the Titanic Dataset

This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python.  
It goes beyond traditional EDA by integrating a **local Large Language Model (LLM)** via **Ollama (Mistral)** to generate automated analytical insights.  
Additionally, a simple **Gradio web interface** allows users to upload their own CSV files and instantly receive both standard EDA outputs and AI-powered insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Data loading, summary statistics, missing value handling, and cleaning.  
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of patterns using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Leverages **Ollama (Mistral)** to analyze dataset summaries and provide human-like insights.  
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with **Gradio**, enabling users to upload any CSV file and run automated EDA.
